Elements may also be grouped together in a section toso that the area of the page grouped by the sectionto can be formatted with the same style, or background color such as the example.

                   <article><strong>Article 2:</strong>THe articles do not necessarily have to go inside the section, however if the articles are to be formatted into a single container, for example they need to be positioned or sized together, you can achieve this by placing both in a single section and fromatting the section. The articles will inherit the formatting applied to the section.
